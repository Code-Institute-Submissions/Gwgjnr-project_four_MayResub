## UX

For this project, I decided to build a web application that allows users to find or post events in their area. I settled on this idea as the Covid pandemic has made it more difficult to meet new people. This application allows users to easily link up with like minded individuals by joining events.  

### User Stories

"**_As a user, I would like to_** _____________________________"

- Navigate the site using a navbar and footer.
- Sign into an account.
- View events.
- Post events.
- Register for an event.
- View the number of spots remaining on an event.
- Filter available events.
- Draft events. 

### Design

When deciding on the design, I wanted to create an informal and inviting space to encourage interaction from users. I aimed to style the events as post it notes on a pin board to create a familiar feel for users. 

#### Framework

- [Bootstrap 4.4.1](https://www.djangoproject.com/)

- [Django 3.2](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
